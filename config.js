        title: "ðŸŽ‚ Happy Birthday Parna! ðŸ¦‹",
        content: `Dear Parna,

On this special day, I wanted to create something magical just for you. Our friendship has been one of the most beautiful journeys of my life, filled with laughter, shared dreams, and countless precious moments.

From our college days in the Mechanical lab to all our journeys, every memory we've shared holds a special place in my heart. Your honesty, your smile, and the way you see the world have always inspired me. I know that whenever I feel low, I can talk to you without hesitation â€” you make me feel so comfortable and understood.

Of course, sometimes I do get disappointed in you too, but those feelings never last long, because what we share is much deeper and stronger than that. For your birthday, I wanted to try something new. I know this isnâ€™t perfect â€” itâ€™s my first attempt â€” but itâ€™s made entirely for you, from the heart. There may be flaws, but remember that this little gift is a reflection of how much you mean to me.

I hope it brings a smile to your face and reminds you of how special you are. You deserve all the happiness, love, and success in the world.

Happy Birthday, my dear friend! May your day be as magical and beautiful as you are.

With love and gratitude,
Rishita ðŸ’–âœ¨`

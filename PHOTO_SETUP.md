# 📸 How to Add Your Photo to the Puzzle

## 🎯 **Step 1: Prepare Your Photo**
- Choose a **square photo** (1:1 ratio) for best results
- Recommended size: **600x600 pixels** or larger
- Make sure it's a **clear, high-quality image**
- Choose a photo that's **meaningful to your friendship**

## 🖼️ **Step 2: Add the Photo File**
1. **Save your photo** in the same folder as your website files
2. **Rename it** to `your-friendship-photo.jpeg` (or change the filename in the code)
3. **Supported formats**: JPG, JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP

## 🔧 **Step 3: Update the Code (if needed)**
If you want to use a different filename, edit `script.js` line ~350:

```javascript
img.src = 'your-friendship-photo.jpg'; // Change this to your filename
```

## 📁 **File Structure**
Your folder should look like this:
```
birthday-gift/
├── index.html
├── styles.css
├── script.js
├── config.js
├── README.md
├── PHOTO_SETUP.md
└── your-friendship-photo.jpeg  ← Your photo here!
```

## 💡 **Photo Ideas**
- **Selfie together** from a special moment
- **Group photo** with friends
- **Memorable place** you visited together

## ⚠️ **Important Notes**
